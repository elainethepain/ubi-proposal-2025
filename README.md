## 🎉 Welcome to Your Community-First UBI Toolkit!

Built for close-knit circles, local clubs, or community cooperatives, you’re here because you believe in fairness, transparency, and inclusive governance. Here's how this toolkit helps your community run your own UBI system, democratically and reliably:

---

### 🗳️ Customizable Voting Tokens & Governance Rules

* **Tailored tokens**: Create adjustable voting tokens just right for your group.
* **Configure thresholds**: Set support and quorum levels so every decision matches your group's expectations.
* **Flexible timelines**: Define voting phases with start dates and durations that fit your pace and culture.
  These settings offer the freedom to shape governance that aligns with your tokenomics and demographics.

---

### 📂 Proposal Management—All Trails Tracked

* **Submit with ease**: Let members propose ideas or initiatives whenever inspiration strikes.
* **Track transparently**: Watch as proposals move through discussion, voting, and execution—all in one space.
* **Seamless lifecycle**: From proposal idea → vote → outcome, every step is clear and well‑tracked.

---

### 👥 Voter Authentication & Openness

* **Secure access**: Require wallet-based login to verify identity before voting.
* **On-chain votes**: Every vote is logged publicly on-chain, so anyone can audit or verify results.
* **Full transparency**: Build trust with everyone by making votes immutably visible—yet preserving privacy at individual level.

---

### ⚙️ Rules You Can Adapt

* **Quorum settings**: Choose how many members need to participate before a vote counts.
* **Support thresholds**: Decide what percentage is required to pass a proposal.
* **Timeline control**: Set how long discussions and voting last—daily, weekly, biweekly—you decide.
  This lets you run whichever democratic model suits your values and operations best.

---

## 🚀 Why This Toolkit?

* **Empower your members**—everyone can create, discuss, and vote with full clarity.
* **Remove gatekeepers**—no top-down rules. Your small community rules together.
* **Build trust**—all votes and proposals are visible and auditable.

## 🌱 Built for Community Flourishing

Much like innovative UBI-like plugins and DAOs emerging in Web3 today, this toolkit is democratic, anti-Sybil, and easy to use. Platforms like UBI built on Proof of Humanity have paved the way—verifying humans, preventing vote fraud, and using **quadratic voting** to ensure balance.
It’s the perfect foundation for small groups to launch UBI governance with transparency and fairness.
